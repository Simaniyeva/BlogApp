Mrs. Mirvan says, she will not even think, till she hears your opinion.

Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes&apos; attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate?</p><h3 id="you-don-t-come-into-cooking-to-get-rich">You don&apos;t come into cooking to get rich</h3><p>I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade&apos;s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes&apos; insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy&apos;s innocence.</p><blockquote>Cooking is like anything else: some people have an inborn talent for it. Some become expert by practicing, and some learn from books. - Laurie Colwin</blockquote><p>It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.</p><p>&quot;The glass still keeps very high,&quot; he remarked as he sat down. &quot;It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what did you learn from him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Could he throw no light?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot admire his taste,&quot; I remarked, &quot;if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.&quot;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507048331197-7d4ac70811cf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="I do not stick to rules when cooking.

The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: &quot;It is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out.</p><blockquote>We are working 24x7 to rescue as much people as possible in less time. - Army General</blockquote><p>I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.&quot; And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: &quot;But It is here, and I&apos;ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I&apos;ll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.&quot; And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it&apos;s no use my trying to stop him. He can&apos;t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as &quot;clay,&quot; and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can&apos;t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous]]></title><description><![CDATA[Though thus elevated into fame, and conscious of uncommon powers, he had not that bustling confidence, or, I may rather say, that animated ambition, which one might have supposed would have urged him to endeavour at rising in life.

Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet.</p><h3 id="you-must-change-your-preconceived-notion">You must change your preconceived notion</h3><p>Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.</p><blockquote>To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries.</blockquote><p>&quot;What a place to find one&apos;s divinity in!&quot; said Lord Henry. &quot;Yes!&quot; answered Dorian Gray. &quot;It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one&apos;s self.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The same flesh and blood as one&apos;s self! Oh, I hope not!&quot; exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1475490729148-5f9e99a6295a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="Don&apos;t listen to what they say, go see" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@monicasilva?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Monica Silva</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>&quot;Don&apos;t pay any attention to him, Dorian,&quot; said the painter. &quot;I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.

To spiritualize one&apos;s age--that is something worth doing.</p><p>If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you.

Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield&#x2019;s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1483683804023-6ccdb62f86ef?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="Stop worrying about the potholes in the road and enjoy the journey" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dnevozhai?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Denys Nevozhai</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor&#x2019;s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.</p><h3 id="travel-with-no-regrets">Travel with no regrets</h3><p>Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding.</p><blockquote>Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.</blockquote><p>The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer&#x2019;s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined.</p><h3 id="leave-yourself-behind">Leave yourself behind</h3><p>He might see a reason for his friend&#x2019;s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will.

In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.</p><h3 id="climb-the-mountain-so-you-can-see-the-world">Climb the mountain so you can see the world</h3><p>And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o&#x2019;clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1483921020237-2ff51e8e4b22?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="Stop worrying about the potholes in the road and enjoy the journey" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@erol?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Erol Ahmed</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. </li><li>In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city.</li><li>Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.</li><li>The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street.</li><li>The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with.</li><li>He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher&#x2019;s inclination.</li><li>But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.</li></ul><p>Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. &#x201C;Mr. Hyde, I think?&#x201D;</p><p>Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath.
